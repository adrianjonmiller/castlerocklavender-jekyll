        <div class="content">
          <p><strong>October 2011</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">These ideas are from <em> The Naturally Clean Home</em> by Karyn Siegel-Maier</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Did you know that you can use Lavender to<em><strong> polish wood</strong></em>?  This is how you do it:  Combine 1/4 cup of linseed oil with 3 drops of lavender essential oil in a glass bowl.  Apply lightly to wood with a clean soft cloth.  Rub into the wood using a circular motion and a soft cloth.  Using another clean soft cloth, wipe the surface.  You can store this is a glass jar with a tight fitting lid.  Make up a larger batch but be sure to shake it to mix the oils before each use.  Your wood will look so good ~ and just think how it will smell.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Here is another neat trick for <strong><em>polishing Stainless Steel</em></strong> <em><strong>or your Barbeque Grill</strong></em>   In a glass bowl combine 1/2 cup of water with 5 teaspoons of baking soda and 10 drops of lavender essential oil.  It will make a thin paste, adding a bit more baking soda if necessary to make it pasty.  Blend well and using a soft cloth wipe this onto any stainless steel appliance exterior using a circular motion.  Rinse with plain water or a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar.  Buffing with a dry soft cloth will give your stainless steel appliances lots of shine.  And the smell. . . .mmmm</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Now you can<em><strong> eliminate those </strong><strong>funny odors in your car</strong></em>.  Were did they come from anyway?  Get yourself an 8 ounce plastic spray bottle and add the following ingredients:  3/4 cup water, 1/4 cup vinegar, 10 drops lavender essential oil, 4 drops lemon essential oil, and 2 drops peppermint essential oil.  Shake it up really well and holding the spray bottle about 6 to 8 inches from the surfaces, lightly mist the carpet and upholstery.  Leave the windows and doors open for a while.  Don&#8217;t let your pets inside for a while as the essential oils will irritate their paws and noses (and tongues when they lick themselves off).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>November 2011</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Does your cat litter smell? Do you just love your cat but hate the smell of the litter box? Have you spent big money on pricey cat litter hoping to get rid of the smell? Try adding a small amount of dried Lavender buds to the box. You will notice a difference immediately and after a short while the air around the litter box will smell like lavender. What a treat!! So simple and inexpensive!  And as lavender is in the mint family, as is catnip, Kitty will be happy, too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>January 2012</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">During the winter time our homes are closed up in an effort to stay warm.  Unless we live in the south we don&#8217;t open our windows and refresh the air with breezes.  We can refresh with the purifying, calming, soothing, and uplifting scent of lavender in many ways throughout our homes.  Here are just a few ideas that are simple and will bring the scent of lavender into every room in our homes. </span></p>
<ul><li><span style="color: #800080;">throw some dried lavender stems on a dying fire in your fireplace</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">burn lavender scented candles in any room to refresh</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">use lavender sachets in clothes closets, drawers, and linen closets</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">keep a bowl of dried lavender buds in your bedroom</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">add a few drops of lavender essential oil to your furnace filter to freshen the whole house</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">boil 3 tablespoons of lavender buds in about 4 cups of water.  After letting it sit until it is cool (steeping) put it in a spray bottle and use it on pets and their sleeping areas.</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">sprinkle some lavender buds under the couch cushions to spread their fragrance as you sit on the couch and later when you vacuum them up.</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">add 8 to 10 drops of lavender essential oil to a warm bath to relax you ready for bed</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">add a bowl of lavender buds to that table by the front door to greet your guests</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">add lavender oil to your air purifier</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">use lavender buds in place of other carpet fresheners</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">place lavender in your basement or pantry to discourage insects</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">plant lavender around your home, your patio or other out-door living space, and around your garden to discourage insects</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">refresh a pot pourri with a few drops of lavender essential oil</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">use a few drops of lavender essential oil in a lamp oil ring to give off its fragrance as the light bulb heats the oil</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">add a drop of lavender essential oil to the final rinse of delicate laundry to impart its fragrance to your laundry</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">add lavender essential oil to a diffuser</span></li><li><span style="color: #800080;">mix some lavender essential oil with lamp oil to offset the lamp oil odor and add fragrance to  the room</span></li></ul>

        <h5 class="font--light page--uses-posts-title">Culinary Lavender</h5>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Lavender is an herb that is often overlooked when filling your spice rack.  However, fresh lavender flowers are excellent additions to several desserts.  The dried lavender buds are more herbal and more suited for savory and meat dishes. The entire stalk of lavender with leaves and flowers can be used to infuse vinegar, oil, and sugar. Remember to use organically grown products. Culinary lavender is a versatile herb used in many recipes by professional chefs and people who enjoy spicing things up in the kitchen.  There are multiple ways in which the pretty purple hue of lavender adds to the look of a dish, and its flavor contributes a floral, citrus, sometime peppery, note to sweet and savory dishes. It always surprises me to learn the number of varieties that exist from a species of plant, and lavender offers an assortment of over 200. All lavender plants look and smell wonderful but not all are meant for use in the kitchen. Culinary lavender is suited for use in recipes and adds pleasant flavor to recipes.  The English lavenders have a sweeter fragrance and are most often used in cooking.  Non-culinary lavender varieties have more of an intense flowery perfume, medicinal, bitter or soapy taste.</p>

        <h5 class="font--light page--uses-posts-title">Chicken Presseda</h5>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="p1">The name <i>pressada</i> indicates chicken pressed between two layers of lavender, and it is based on a dish made with thyme that I enjoyed in Italy, south of Naples. This is a true gardener&#8217;s recipe because few non-gardeners could afford to buy the amount of fresh lavender required!</p>
<p class="p1">The quick-cooking chicken first steams between two layers of freshly-cut lavender. Then the cooked chicken is stripped of lavender and quickly browned on a grill. Serve the chicken on rice pilaf or a bed of colorful mesclun. While you are eating you can add the leftover lavender foliage to the coals to produce a heady lavender fragrance.</p>
<p class="p1">6 to 8 chicken breasts or other cuts, bones and skins removed</p>
<p class="p1">Olive oil for brushing</p>
<p class="p1">5 gallon bucket loosely filled with fresh lavender foliage and flower stalks.</p>
<p class="p1">Light a fire in a charcoal grill. Meanwhile, rinse the chicken parts thoroughly under cold water and pat dry. Once the flames are out and the coals are white at the edges, arrange coals in a uniform layer. Place the grill rack over the coals and set a 10-inch-by-20-inch cast-iron pancake griddle on top of the rack. The griddle should be directly above the hot coals (less than ½ inch). Heat the griddle until it is nearly orange-hot. When oil dropped on the griddle dances and sizzles, you&#8217;re ready to begin. Quickly coat the griddle with olive oil, which prevents the herbs from sticking and makes cleaning easier.</p>
<p class="p1">DO NOT USE a PLASTIC BRUSH! The heat of the pan will melt the bristles.</p>
<p class="p1">Working quickly, layer up to 2 inches of lavender foliage on the griddle with the stems all running in one direction. Be sure to cover the griddle thoroughly with lavender and leave no holes. Lay the chicken on top of the lavender, with the lengths of the pieces perpendicular to the lengths of lavender. Cover the chicken thoroughly with another two inches of lavender foliage. Set a baking sheet on top of the chicken-and-lavender &#8220;sandwich.&#8221; Stack 5-10 bricks evenly on top of the baking sheet to compress the lavender and chicken (the <i>pressada</i> part). Because the heat supercharges the volatile essential oils in the lavender, the resulting steam and oil mixture quickly cook the chicken. The chicken may only need 5 to 10 minutes per side if the griddle was orange hot, 15-20 minutes if the charcoal wasn&#8217;t hot enough. When the chicken is done on one side (i.e., a knife score shows only white flesh), remove the bricks and baking sheet and use tongs to turn the entire sandwich as quickly as possible. The lavender and chicken will usually hold together enough to allow you to turn them as a unified whole. You&#8217;ll either amaze your guests or have to reassemble the lavender-and-chicken sandwich while eating humble pie. Practice makes perfect! When the chicken is juicy but no pink flesh shows when meat is tested with a knife, remove the bricks and baking sheet and the top layer of lavender foliage. Lift the chicken off the bottom layer of foliage and place on platter. Then remove lavender and the griddle from the grill rack. Quickly restoke the coals and place chicken pieces on the grill rack, setting them at a diagonal to the line of the rack. Briefly brown the chicken on both sides. Transfer to a serving platter.                                Source: <a href="http://www.lavenderfarm.com/book_reviews.htm"><span class="s1"><i>The Lavender Garden</i></span></a> by Robert Kourik</p>
