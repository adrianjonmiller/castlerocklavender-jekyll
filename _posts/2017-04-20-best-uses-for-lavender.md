Lavender has many uses, but is probably most known for it’s calming properties. Need help sleeping? maybe your child? You can have a wonderful nights sleep. Lavender oil is just the thing. Try putting some on the bottom of the feet. Now that beats using the drugs that you come to rely on. Castle Rock Lavender organic oil is right from our farm, all natural and nothing added. You would have a hard time I think finding anything that would work better than Lavender Oil that is natural. Many places sell Lavender Oil for $25 to $35 per 15 ML.
