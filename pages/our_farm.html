<p class="editable">Castle Rock Lavender is a small family-run farm nestled on the hillside in Castle Rock Washington. We have over 2000 lavender plants with more than 11 varieties. Though we are not open to the public, we do offer the farm to those who are interested in a wedding venue with a beautiful setting, photo shoots and other event opportunities. In addition to a serene venue space, we offer a variety of farm-made lavender products such as, sachets, dried flowers, lip balm, lotion, lavender essential oil, honey and more all derived from the farm's plants. These products can purchased here on line or at a variety of local SW Washington farmers markets.&nbsp;</p>
