    <p class="editable">Castle Rock Lavender is a small family-run farm nestled on the hillside in Castle Rock Washington. We have over 2000 lavender plants with more than 11 varieties. We open our farm to the public for U-pick in mid-June and continue through mid August. Visitors can enjoy spectacular views of the surrounding countryside while immersed in the splendid aroma of our lavender fields.<br />In addition to U-pick, visitors can also browse the store and purchase farm-made lavender products such as, sachets, dried flowers, lip balm, lotion, lavender essential oil, honey and more all derived from the farm's plants.</p>
